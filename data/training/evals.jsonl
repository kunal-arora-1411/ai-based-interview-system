{"question": "What is Python's GIL?", "answer": "Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex (lock) used by the CPython interpreter to ensure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems.Why it exists: Python’s memory management (especially reference counting for garbage collection) isn’t thread-safe by default. The GIL simplifies implementation by preventing race conditions.Effect: It limits true parallelism in CPU-bound Python code (threads don’t run simultaneously on multiple cores).Workarounds:Use multiprocessing (spawns separate processes, each with its own GIL).Use C extensions / NumPy that release the GIL for heavy computations.Use asyncio or concurrency for I/O-bound tasks (network/file).Key takeaway: GIL is not a problem for I/O-bound or multi-process workloads, but it’s a bottleneck for CPU-bound multi-threaded programs in Python.", "score": 0.8, "justification": "Writes simple Python scripts, understands basic data structures", "followup_question": "What optimizes PostgreSQL?"}

Configuration TuningAdjust memory parameters in postgresql.conf:shared_buffers (~25–40% of RAM) for caching.work_mem for complex queries/sorting.effective_cache_size to reflect OS-level cache.Tune max_connections, checkpoint_timeout, wal_buffers for workload.3. Index & Vacuum StrategyRun VACUUM (FULL) and ANALYZE regularly to avoid bloat and keep statistics fresh.Use autovacuum for ongoing cleanup.Avoid unnecessary indexes (they slow down writes).4. Scaling TechniquesUse connection pooling (PgBouncer, Pgpool-II).Partition large tables (declarative partitioning).Enable parallel queries for heavy workloads.Replicate with Streaming Replication or Logical Replication for scale-out reads.5.

{"question": "How do you evaluate caching?", "answer": "Evaluating caching means checking if it is actually helping improve performance, resource usage, and cost. You can approach it like this:1. Hit RatioCache Hit Rate = (Cache Hits ÷ Total Requests).A higher ratio means more requests are served from cache instead of the backend.Target usually >80% for web apps, but depends on workload.2. Latency ImprovementMeasure request response time with cache vs. without cache.Cached responses should be significantly faster (milliseconds vs. seconds).Tools: ab, wrk, or built-in metrics from Redis/Memcached.3. Backend Load ReductionCheck DB queries or API calls avoided due to cache.Fewer hits on DB/API = caching works.Helps in scaling and reduces costs.4. Freshness & ConsistencyVerify if cached data is up-to-date (especially with write-heavy workloads).Strategies: TTL (time-to-live), cache invalidation, write-through/write-back policies.Wrong or stale data can hurt more than slow data.5.
