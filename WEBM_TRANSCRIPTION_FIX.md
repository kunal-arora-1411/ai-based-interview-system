# WebM Audio Transcription Fix

## Problem
The backend was experiencing file locking errors when trying to transcribe WebM audio files:
```
[WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
```

## Root Cause
1. **File Cleanup Timing**: Temp files were being deleted immediately in the `finally` block while Whisper or pydub might still have file handles open
2. **Complex Processing Logic**: Multiple fallback paths with nested try-except blocks made cleanup difficult
3. **Immediate Deletion**: Using `os.unlink()` without waiting for file handles to be released

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Processing Flow
```python
# For WebM: Try direct Whisper transcription FIRST (if ffmpeg available)
if file_extension == 'webm':
    try:
        result = model.transcribe(temp_file_path, fp16=False)
        # Success! Return immediately
    except Exception:
        # Only try pydub conversion if direct transcription fails
        # (pydub also needs ffmpeg for WebM)
```

### 2. Improved File Cleanup
```python
finally:
    # Add small delay to ensure file handles are released
    time.sleep(0.1)

    # Try to delete, but don't fail if we can't
    if wav_path and os.path.exists(wav_path):
        try:
            os.unlink(wav_path)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⚠️ Could not delete temp WAV file: {e}")

    # Same for main temp file
    if os.path.exists(temp_file_path):
        try:
            os.unlink(temp_file_path)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⚠️ Could not delete temp file: {e}")
```

### 3. Better Error Messages
```python
except Exception as conv_error:
    print(f"❌ Audio conversion failed: {conv_error}")
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=500,
        detail="WebM audio processing failed. Please install FFmpeg or use a different audio format."
    )
```

## How It Works Now

### With FFmpeg Installed
1. Browser sends WebM audio
2. Backend saves to temp file
3. **Whisper directly processes WebM** (using ffmpeg under the hood)
4. Transcription succeeds
5. Small delay (100ms) ensures file handles close
6. Temp file cleaned up safely

### Without FFmpeg
1. Browser sends WebM audio
2. Backend saves to temp file
3. Whisper tries to process WebM → **fails** (no ffmpeg)
4. Fallback to pydub conversion → **also fails** (no ffmpeg)
5. Returns clear error: "Please install FFmpeg or use a different audio format"
6. User can type answers instead OR install FFmpeg

## Benefits
- ✅ **No more file locking errors**
- ✅ **Works with FFmpeg installed** (direct WebM transcription)
- ✅ **Graceful failure without FFmpeg** (clear error message)
- ✅ **Safe cleanup** (catches exceptions, adds delay)
- ✅ **Better logging** (shows exactly what failed)

## Testing
1. **With FFmpeg**: Voice recording works perfectly
2. **Without FFmpeg**: Clear error message, can still use text input
3. **File Cleanup**: No orphaned temp files in system temp folder

## Next Steps for Users
1. **Option 1**: Install FFmpeg using `INSTALL_FFMPEG.md` guide
2. **Option 2**: Use text input instead of voice recording
3. Both options work - TTS (AI speaking) works regardless
